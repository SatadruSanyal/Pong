# Pong
__A game of pong with arcade-style graphics written in C; designed to be playable multiplayer or single player. First player to 5 wins (can be easily modified)__ 

## Features:
        - Standard 2 player mode
        - Single player mode with 5 difficulty levels (Loser, Easy, Medium, Hard, Unbeatable)
        - Wacky ball bouncing dynamics for unpredictable and fun gameplay
        

## Bugs: 
        - Ball occasionally does not bounce off of paddles if the collission happens in a corner
        - No keyboard button should be held down, as this will cause the movement of the sticks to be held up.
          (keys should be pressed one at a time, as many times as needed to move the sticks to the right place)
